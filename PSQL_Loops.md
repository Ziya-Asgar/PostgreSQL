Looping constructs in PostgreSQL must be used inside a PL/pgSQL code block, which can be:

- An anonymous code block (`DO $$ ... $$;`)
- A PL/pgSQL function (`CREATE FUNCTION ... LANGUAGE plpgsql;`)
- A stored procedure (`CREATE PROCEDURE ... LANGUAGE plpgsql;`)

## `LOOP`

The `LOOP` statement allows to execute a code block repeatedly. Here’s the basic syntax of the `LOOP` statement:

```sql
-- optional loop label
<<label>>
LOOP
    statement;
END LOOP [label];
```

Typically, WE use an `IF` statement to terminate the loop based on a condition like this:

```sql
<<label>>
loop
   statements;
   if condition then
      exit;
   end if;
end loop;
```

When we have nested loops, it’s necessary to use loop labels.

## `WHILE`

The `WHILE` statement allows you to execute a code block repeatedly if a condition is true. Since the `WHILE` statement evaluates the condition before each iteration, it is known as a pretest loop. Here’s the syntax of the `WHILE` statement:

```sql
[<<label>>]
WHILE condition LOOP
    statements;
END LOOP;
```

## `FOR`

The `FOR` loop statement creates a loop that iterates over a range of integers or rows of a result set. Here’s the basic syntax of the `FOR` loop statement that iterates over a range of integers from low to high:

```sql
<<label>>
FOR loop_counter IN low..high LOOP
    statements;
END LOOP [label];
```

By default, the `FOR` loop increments or decrements the loop counter by one after each iteration. If you want to change the step from 1 to another, you can use the `BY` option:

```sql
<<label>>
FOR loop_counter IN low..high [BY step] LOOP
    statements;
END LOOP [label];
```

If you use the `REVERSE` option, the FOR loop will decrement the loop counter after each iteration. Notice that the `high` and `low` are in reversed order.:

```sql
<<label>>
FOR loop_counter IN REVERSE high..low LOOP
    statements;
END LOOP [label];
```

To iterate over the rows of a result set, you use the following `FOR` loop statement:

```sql
[ <<label>> ]
FOR target IN query LOOP
    -- process individual row
END LOOP [ label ];
```

## Terminating a loop using `EXIT`

We can specify a condition for terminating the loop using the `IF` and `EXIT` statement:

```sql
<<label>>
LOOP
    statement;
    IF condition THEN
        EXIT;
    END IF;
END LOOP [label];
```

The `EXIT` statement terminates a loop, including `LOOP`, `FOR LOOP`, and `WHILE LOOP`. To terminate based on a condition, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
EXIT loop_label WHEN condition;
```

or:

```sql
EXIT WHEN condition;
```

## Skipping a loop using `CONTINUE`

The `CONTINUE` statement skips the remaining statements in the current iteration of a loop and starts a new iteration based on a condition.

We can use `CONTINUE` either this way:

```sql
CONTINUE;
```

or using an optional loop label:

```sql
CONTINUE loop_label;
```

We can use `CONTINUE` with an `IF` clause:

```sql
IF condition THEN
    CONTINUE;
END IF;
```

or use a more concise syntax:

```sql
CONTINUE WHEN condition;
```
